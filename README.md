# Fashion Recommendation System
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This project implements an image feature extraction pipeline using VGG16 (pre-trained on ImageNet) to build a Fashion Recommendation System. The extracted feature vectors can later be used for similarity search, clustering, or recommendation tasks (e.g., suggesting visually similar clothing items).

# 📌 Features
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Uses VGG16 CNN model without the classification head (include_top=False) for feature extraction.
- Preprocesses input images to match VGG16’s expected format (224×224, normalized).
- Extracts deep feature vectors from images.
- Normalizes features for better similarity comparison.
- Stores features and image names for building a recommendation index.

# 🛠️ Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Python 3.12
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Install dependencies:
- pip install tensorflow numpy

# 🚀 How It Works
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Load VGG16 pre-trained model without top classification layers.
- Preprocess each input image (224x224, normalization).
- Extract feature embeddings from the CNN.
- Flatten and normalize features.
- Store extracted features and corresponding image names for later use in recommendation tasks.

# 🔮 Future Enhancements
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Build a similarity search engine (using FAISS or Nearest Neighbors).
- Deploy as a Fashion Recommendation API or Web App.
- Add clustering to categorize similar fashion styles.
